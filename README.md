# PID-on-LFR
This is something i worked on as a freshmen for my calculus final project. I made two controllers the first one is a simple bang bang controller using 3 IRs(D2,D4,D6) while the other one is a manually tuned PID controller.

Hardware Used:- 
  1) Arduino Uno
  2) L298N motor driver
  3) N20 motors and wheels
  4) SmartElex RLS-08 sensor array
  5) Li-ion batteries corresponding to 7.4V
  6) Jumper Wires

Please tune the PID according to your specific bot by following any tutorial online.
